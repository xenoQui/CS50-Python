# CS50 - Python
This repository contains my personal python code for [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

Contained in each week's folder is a README.md file for each week. It contains information such as the lecture link and problem set link.

### ❗ The following codes are for educational purpose only and not intended to be used/submitted as your own solutions.
### ❗ Cheating violates the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/) of the course, not to mention it's totally pointless if you actually want to learn programming.
